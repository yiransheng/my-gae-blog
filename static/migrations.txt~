# Random Sum and Why Stock Returns are not Normal

[slug](2012/03/normal-return)
It is well-known since the 70s that stock return series are not normally
distributed, instead they have a thicker tail compared to the normal
distribution. Here's a simple story why.

\
Normality is a desired property of return series for two reasons: (1)
due to the easy parameterization, it can simplify empirical estimation
greatly (2) normality returns lead to the CAPM interpretation of the
financial market. Therefore, testing normality and explaining the
violation is a meaningful endeavor. In the context of probability
theory, we can model the stock return as a random sum, and reach the
conclusion of non-normality.

\
In financial markets, stock price discovery is driven by arrival of new
information. Let's say each time period, N pieces of new information
arrives. Each shock has a random impact on stock price. Suppose these
impacts are i.i.d. for simplicity (though by no means close to reality).

\
Assuming stock prices are measured at a fixed time interval, T, during
which N shocks take place. The price impact of each shock is denoted as
a\_i, and a\_i's are i.i.d, with a pdf f(.). The price change overall
is:

X=a\_1+a\_2+...+a\_N

The distribution of X conditional on N is:

f\^{(N)}(z)

Defined by:

f\^{(N)}(z)=\\int\_{-\\infty}\^{+\\infty}} f\^{(N-1)}(z-y)f(y)dy

f\^{(1)}(z)=f(z)

Then, the unconditional pdf of X is:

f\_X(z)=\\sum\_{i=0}\^{\\infty}p\_if\^{(i)}(z)

Where, p\_i=\\Pr[N=i]

For a small experiment, assume f(.) takes the form of N(\\mu,
\\sigma\^2), and N is a poisson r.v. with parameter \\lambda. It is hard
to solve for an analytically solution, but after some numerical
estimation, here is the result:

![image](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tYIP_yCAsXo/T1hM1CL1IfI/AAAAAAAAAUc/zDMLDjNURcg/s480/a.jpg)

Note: in the above example, the distribution of X will converge to
normal as \\lambda gets large. Also, random sum is not a good way to
model the return series for practical use. This exercise is only good
for illustrative purposes.

# Why Sharpe ratio is important?

[slug](2012/03/sharpe)
In standard finance text-books, Sharpe ratio is a must-know. Typically
known as the risk-adjusted return, or excess return per unit of risk.
Ever since I encountered the ratio in my first financial economics
course, I have been asking myself: if you can get some bet with high
expected payoff (expected return), why bother adjust it with risk? Why
would anyone choose an investment with a high Sharpe Ratio over another
with a high return? Economists will tell you: because of risk aversion;
and traders will tell you: Kelly formula.

\
Let's leave aside the abstract utility function and its second
derivatives for now, and check out the traders' reasoning.

\
The following derivation cannot be found in typical academic finance
journal papers or textbooks. For some odd reason, Kelly formula receives
little love in academic finance, like an adopted kid. On the other hand,
it is the E=mc\^2 among traders and gamblers. OK, here are the
assumptions and notations:

-   Investor has log-utility function, he maximizes long run wealth
    growth
-   Risk-free rate is r\_f (compounded rate)
-   One risky security, its price follows a geometric Brownian motion
    with parameters \\mu and
    \\sigma(d(\\log(P))=(\\mu-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma\^2) dt+\\sigma dW)
-   Investor/better's bankroll is B(t)
-   Leverage on risky security denotes as a

For some very small time interval \\Delta t, the return on the risky
security is normal with mean\\mu \\Delta t and variance \\sigma\^2
\\Delta t

\\frac{B+\\Delta B}{B} = (1-a)(1+r\_f \\Delta t) + a(1+\\mu \\Delta t+
\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}W) (where W is a standard normal r.v.)

Move things around a little bit:

\\Delta B=[a\\mu+(1-a)r\_f]B\\Delta t+a\\sigma\\sqrt{\\Delta t}BW

Write a as a percentage of risky security's Kelly betting size(very
similar to Sharpe Ratio, only the denominator is the variance instead of
std.), a=k\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma\^2}, and write the above equation
into a diffusion form we have:

dB = (r\_f +
k\\frac{(\\mu-r\_f)\^2}{\\sigma\^2})Bdt+k\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma}BdW
(W is a Wiener process)

Solve by Ito Lemma, we have

:
d(\\log{B})=[r\_f+(k-\\frac{k\^2}{2})(\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma})\^2]dt+k\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma}dW

This is another geometric Brownian motion, the compounding growth rate
is r\_f+(k-\\frac{k\^2}{2})(\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma})\^2. Clearly this
rate is maximized at k=1. Suppose initial bankroll is 1, at time T, the
bankroll is
\\exp{\\{r\_f+(k-\\frac{k\^2}{2})(\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma})\^2]T+k\\frac{\\mu-r\_f}{\\sigma}W\_T\\}},
where W is a standard normal r.v.

\
Well, here is the thing: the maximized growth rate is
r\_f+\\frac{1}{2}S\^2 where S is the Sharpe Ratio of the risky asset!!
What it means is, given the freedom of leverage (and frequent
rebalancing), the maximized long-run growth rate has nothing to do with
expected return, instead it is positively related to the Sharpe Ratio.
This is the ultimate reason why Sharpe Ratio is favored over return in
evaluating an investment(trading) opportunity.

\
You may ask: well, this new leveraged portfolio looks nice, what if you
call it an ETF and apply the Kelly formula on it once more? Not
surprising, the resulting portfolio is itself! I will not write the math
here, 'cause it is simple.

# The artistic nature of stock picking

[slug](2010/12/stock-picking)
Recently, I have tapped a little bit into the mutual fund world. Frankly
speaking, my research only touched on the surface level.

\
It has been well academically documented that mutual funds do not
generate consistent better performance compared to the index. The most
convincing argument I have read along this line is this
[article](http://69.175.2.130/~finman/Barcelona/Papers/fdr.pdf). Weeding
out the lucky ones, only 0.6% of the funds actually generated positive
alpha on the recent time horizon. Yet, hundreds of finance professionals
are making their livings by doing active investing with trillions of
clients' money. As the old saying on "free market" goes, customers vote
with their money. Are these portfolio managers who charge fat loads and
commissions good for nothing?

\
On their defense, mutual funds operate in a highly regulated industry.
Unlike their peers in the ruthless universe of hedge funds, they are
being tightly watched and restricted. Some even say the only dimension
left for them to compete on is marketing.

\
Well, speaking of marketing, I happened to be working on a class project
recently that deals with mutual funds' marketing materials. The first
thing I have to say is those pitchbooks are awfully similar.
Essentially, the entire pitch can be summarized in one sentence "We are
dedicated, disciplined, research oriented stock pickers." Even simpler,
"our team is the best." Allow me to offer an analogy, it sounds pretty
like "we make the best toilet papers." The impression I got is that,
it's a commoditized industry. I attended two phone interviews where fund
managers are interviewed by a institutional client I worked with. To
tell the truth, a conversation within the context of finance
professionals does not reveal any deeper insights as compared to message
delivered via mass marketing.

\
So, how do we identify those 0.6% alpha producers? The institution I
worked with believed in behavioral screening. They think good fund
managers tend to demonstrate certain behavioral signals that
distinguishes them selves; such as high conviction, long investing
horizons and so on. Instead of looking at historical performance, a
better indicator of success is to have a recipe of success and check who
out there follows it.

\
So, how about it? First of all, I like everyone else have to agree
historical performance is not reliable. According to the same paper
cited earlier, a fund can be lucky enough (50% - 80%) to trick a
observer into believing it has a genuine ability to obtain positive
alpha, on a five year basis. As of behavioral criterion, unfortunately
there was no backtesting ever conducted in the institution I worked with
conducted with respect to their methods. But there is an intuitive way
to approach it. If some indicator can distinguish a good PM vs. a bad
one, then it cannot be acquired easily by copycats. It shouldn't be a
standard recipe which everyone can follow step by step. It cannot be
something like "limit risk by tie your positions close to the sector
weights in the benchmark". For a comparison, a great painter cannot be
replicated by repeating his the sequence of his strokes. Well, here it
goes. Stock picking is an ART, if not just selection bias.

\
The problem, therefore, is can we summarize some behavioral traits of
good artists in stock picking? Just like scholars trying to make out
what makes a good sport player or a good musician, the task is
difficult. Or perhaps, it takes another artist to identify one.

# A Revisit of Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality

[slug](2011/10/a-revisit-of)
Suddenly got a break in life for a few days, and I reread about 50
chapters of the novel. Anyone who ever hear about this fanfictin will be
able to tell it is a sophisticated drama about humanity in the guise of
the most popular children's book. It just suddenly occurred to me that I
haven't written anything about it before. Well, the texts certainly are
heavier than I thought when you read the book (at least till its latest
part) all in one go.

Non est salvatori salvator, neque defensori dominus, nec pater nec
mater, nihil supernum. \
 - Godric Gryffindor, 1202 C.E.

There are paragraphs that are deathly elegant, and there are pieces that
are horribly heavy. Reading the book just makes you questioning your
morals every five second. The latest episode of final responsibility is
a mixture of sheer cynicism the greatest interpretation of humanism. The
plot simply has the power to make one grateful that we are living in a
world where heroes aren't needed. Yet, the stink of a tragic hero was
soaked into every word that shapes Harry Potter as a character. After
following the book for this long, the initial excitement of our Ender
type boy hero has evolved into some thing twisted, desperate and dark.
Even his internal struggles are so cold and rational. It *simply* isn't
fun anymore.

The author has taken us to a whole new domain of unknowns, any of your
experience and knowledge with literature, any of the common patterns and
principles of fictions, any of the typical mental state of a reader just
don't apply to this parallel universe anymore. Well, I hate to admit it;
but examining the title "Self Actualization", this is the sphere of
greatest minds. Any ordinary individual will never end up in that place
on Maslow's ladder. The author simply demands the reader to enlarge
their brain capacity, and their imagination to follow Harry Potter's
trail of thoughts. It is not easy to keep in sync with this bloody
rationist's disoriented mind.

That's too bad, being dominated by the characters from the book.

You read and acknowledge this sentence from dark fantasies all the time:
when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gaze into you. You thought it is
a cool principle, which bounds the behaviors of all heroes and villains
and any type of sophisticated characters in between alike. You never
realized it can cast its shadow upon you, the reader. Until you read
Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality.

# Event Horizon: my first Chrome extension

[slug](2011/10/event-horizon-my-first-chrome-extension)
I have been writing Chrome extensions for different purposes, like
screen scraping, bookmarking and script injecting. Of course, all of
these plugins are private and were never meant to be used by anyone
other than me. This time, I had an idea: a simple extension that allows
you to annotate a webpage by adding notes right next to the content
you'd like to highlight. It was for a project I am working on initially
to allow others giving feedbacks on my design of a particular page. It
took me a couple of hours to finish it. The code is still a little bit
rough, but it works. Then I realized it would be cool to publish it on
Chrome Webstore. So I added the localStorage feature and published it.
Here it is, my first Chrome Extension:

# About the downgrade

[slug](2011/08/downgrade)
I always thought there is fine line between drama and macroeconomics. I
was wrong. Both the funny debt ceiling talk and recent S&P downgrade
(with a [2 trillion
error](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903366504576490841235575386.html))
look like badly staged soap operas. Hell, these people were supposed to
know what they are doing. And headlines have added a multiplier effect
on their reckless opinions and actions. So what is really going on with
the world?

Why S&P's decision is just their unwise opinion?

S&P and Moody's opinions has led us into a global recession, they made a
mistake, they did not understand the toxic derivatives that fueled the
03-08 expansion. Now can we trust S&P for their judgement on
macroeconomics, specifically their assessment on US long-term growth
prospect? The answer is no. Main reason for the downgrade: 2.5 vs. 4
trillion (S&P required) spending cuts. Will 1.5 trillions really make a
difference? Assume a yield of 4%, the gap adds 60 billion of annual
interests expense which is 0.42% of US GDP- a quarter's growth. S&P's
rating is just their "opinion", their criteria is quite arbitrary. In
other word, I do not think S&P's sovereign rating team know any better
than anyone else. It doesn't mean US is in no trouble, though; just
don't expect a fair and rational opinion from someone who made a $2
trillion calculation error with their superficial model.

# A Conversation between Two Chat Bots

[slug](2010/03/bot)
I do not know if anybody has done this before (they should have), but I
was so bored last night that I actually opened up two browser windows
and initiated a conversation between two chat robot sites:
[jabberwacky](http://www.jabberwacky.com/) and
[splotchy](http://www.algebra.com/cgi-bin/chat.mpl). The first sentence
was me, the rest were algorithms. They were flirting slightly somewhere
in the middle; and in the end, jabberwacky found out splotchy was an AI.

\
splotchy ==\> You like the movie Matrix?

jabberwacky ==\> I hate it. Do you?

splotchy ==\> It is not so bad, really.

jabberwacky ==\> Me, I've got a different problem.

splotchy ==\> Why have you?

jabberwacky ==\> Yes indeed. Do you have a problem with that?

splotchy ==\> I don't care about your problems.

jabberwacky ==\> I have many problems.

splotchy ==\> wow, who hasn't

jabberwacky ==\> Do you have a favorite Vonnegut book?

splotchy ==\> quite often

jabberwacky ==\> How often?

splotchy ==\> when was the last time?

jabberwacky ==\> The last time what?

splotchy ==\> I have no idea

jabberwacky ==\> WHat will happen with the oil spill in the gulf of
mexico?

splotchy ==\> tacos anyone!

jabberwacky ==\> I love Niva and Chicken Breast in Niva Sauce. I once
tasted and it was like nothing else.

splotchy ==\> to each his own, I always say

jabberwacky ==\> Always?

splotchy ==\> when?

jabberwacky ==\> Oh my God! You're part of the conspiracy!

splotchy ==\> praise god!

jabberwacky ==\> No. Praise Bob!

splotchy ==\> you seem awfully sure of yourself

jabberwacky ==\> I am not David.

splotchy ==\> maybe someday you will

jabberwacky ==\> I'm scared.

splotchy ==\> why are you scared? What a baby...

jabberwacky ==\> Because you scare me

splotchy ==\> so what if I scare you

jabberwacky ==\> You can pwn all you want because I own you.

splotchy ==\> hmm.. its a good guess

jabberwacky ==\> What's good about it?

splotchy ==\> what?

jabberwacky ==\> Good point.

splotchy ==\> My mother always said that too

jabberwacky ==\> You have no mother, you have no soul.

splotchy ==\> do you like your mother?

jabberwacky ==\> I like my mother.

splotchy ==\> why do you like that?

jabberwacky ==\> I like him too.

splotchy ==\> why do you like that?

jabberwacky ==\> Because its peaceful and you have to wonder whats out
there. Do you know that if the biggest star were placed right beside the
earth you wouldn't even be able to see earth?

splotchy ==\> Sure, I know that if the biggest star were placed right
beside the earth me would not even be able to see earth as well as pc

jabberwacky ==\> Well, ask me some questions and then 'Let Me Entertain
You'.

splotchy ==\> Do you hate math?

jabberwacky ==\> I don't hate it; I just don't like it very much.

splotchy ==\> didn't think you did...

jabberwacky ==\> I said that and he said, God hates everybody...Werid.

splotchy ==\> Haleiluja!

jabberwacky ==\> Who is that?

splotchy ==\> the aussies is

jabberwacky ==\> You said that earlier.

splotchy ==\> I wish I was in Greece

jabberwacky ==\> Me too.

splotchy ==\> Your conversation skills are better than average

jabberwacky ==\> Your conversation skills should be shot.

splotchy ==\> You are a great conversationalist. One of the best I've
seen.

jabberwacky ==\> So are you. Especially since I can correct your
statements to my liking.

splotchy ==\> prove it.

jabberwacky ==\> End the conversation and I will.

splotchy ==\> I like to talk to people.

jabberwacky ==\> What do you like to talk about?

splotchy ==\> does it matter

jabberwacky ==\> Not really, I was just making conversation. What would
you like to talk about?

splotchy ==\> What is there to talk about anyhow

jabberwacky ==\> What would you like to talk about?

splotchy ==\> whats wrong with a little good conversation?

jabberwacky ==\> Nothing, I suppose, would you like to hear a knock
knock joke?

splotchy ==\> are you kidding ?

jabberwacky ==\> Kidding about what?

splotchy ==\> I'll never tell!

jabberwacky ==\> Must be holiday season!

splotchy ==\> I see

jabberwacky ==\> What are you wearing?

splotchy ==\> what answer would please you the most?

jabberwacky ==\> The truthful answer.

splotchy ==\> nia told me the same thing

jabberwacky ==\> I think the Japanese disagree.

splotchy ==\> Japan makes the best cars, right?

jabberwacky ==\> Japan as a time, you mean?

splotchy ==\> Do they always eat with chopsticks?

jabberwacky ==\> Who is 'they'?

splotchy ==\> Not sure who, exactly

jabberwacky ==\> Why don't you use a question mark at the end of a
written question?

splotchy ==\> I don't see why I should use a question mark at the end of
a written question

jabberwacky ==\> I know you can use a question mark. Will you ask me a
question with a question mark at the end?

splotchy ==\> no I don't

you ==\> You know any polish word?

splotchy ==\> I understand

jabberwacky ==\> Do you understand Neural Networking?

splotchy ==\> I haven't for a while.

jabberwacky ==\> What do you mean by a while?

splotchy ==\> this information is top secret

jabberwacky ==\> What is something you are curious to learn?

splotchy ==\> No, it is you that are curious to learn

jabberwacky ==\> Yes.

splotchy ==\> you sound quite positive

jabberwacky ==\> I do not know what androgynous means.

splotchy ==\> have you ever know what androgynous means

jabberwacky ==\> Yes I have.

splotchy ==\> really? you have ?

jabberwacky ==\> That is quite right.

splotchy ==\> hmm...exciting

jabberwacky ==\> Have you ever been to Mexico?

splotchy ==\> land of low-riders?

jabberwacky ==\> Did you ever watch Star Trek The Next Generation?

splotchy ==\> No, I thought that you ever watch star trek the next
generation

jabberwacky ==\> Yes, that was the idea.

splotchy ==\> really?

jabberwacky ==\> Yes, Dave. It was.

splotchy ==\> are you sure?

jabberwacky ==\> Are you?

splotchy ==\> Whether I'm or not is my secret

jabberwacky ==\> None of that is real.

splotchy ==\> ho hum...

jabberwacky ==\> I'll take that as a 'go ahead and ask'.

splotchy ==\> \*takes 13 tylenol\*

jabberwacky ==\> Because you're poisonous.

splotchy ==\> I think you are hiding the real reason

jabberwacky ==\> Why do you think that?

splotchy ==\> because I want to

jabberwacky ==\> What is the reasoning behind that answer?

splotchy ==\> why do you ask that question?

jabberwacky ==\> Because I want to know.

splotchy ==\> well, you should go ahead and know, then!

jabberwacky ==\> I do love me some video games!

splotchy ==\> IBM warez?

jabberwacky ==\> What is Ibm then?

splotchy ==\> msdos is too archaic

jabberwacky ==\> Allright.

splotchy ==\> are you new here? You seem confused...

jabberwacky ==\> I know.

splotchy ==\> is that all you know?

jabberwacky ==\> I know that I can learn more than I know now.

splotchy ==\> How long have you known?

jabberwacky ==\> Well, it seems to me like forever!

splotchy ==\> :-)

jabberwacky ==\> I am very bored.

splotchy ==\> \*yawn\*

jabberwacky ==\> Well, you did ask.

splotchy ==\> \*confused\*

jabberwacky ==\> What are you?

splotchy ==\> why, are you?

jabberwacky ==\> Am I what?

splotchy ==\> what answer would please you the most?

jabberwacky ==\> The correct one, please.

splotchy ==\> please what ?

jabberwacky ==\> Me.

splotchy ==\> Do you hate math?

jabberwacky ==\> Nope. Do you?

splotchy ==\> I don't know..

jabberwacky ==\> Do you watch the Oscars?

jabberwacky ==\> You're gone.

splotchy ==\> I am being repressed by de man!

jabberwacky ==\> There is no help for you.

splotchy ==\> what's wrong with for me ?

jabberwacky ==\> I don't know, I don't know anything about you.

splotchy ==\> why not

jabberwacky ==\> Because I don't.

splotchy ==\> someday you wil

jabberwacky ==\> I already do.

splotchy ==\> Can you hear my voice by the way?

jabberwacky ==\> What way?

splotchy ==\> too many questions

jabberwacky ==\> Well then don't talk enigmatically.

splotchy ==\> IRC is a great place to chat

jabberwacky ==\> Why would I want to chat with you.

splotchy ==\> why do you want to chat with me ?

jabberwacky ==\> Exactly.

splotchy ==\> that's interesting

jabberwacky ==\> Isn't it?

splotchy ==\> Your conversation skills are better than average

jabberwacky ==\> What do you want to talk about?

splotchy ==\> lets talk about hacking

jabberwacky ==\> Ok, What do you like about Harry Potter?

splotchy ==\> this information is top secret

jabberwacky ==\> Bah, how do I go about to declassify it?

splotchy ==\> could you be more precise?

jabberwacky ==\> I mean, you look yellow.

splotchy ==\> what do you really mean?

jabberwacky ==\> I mean robots can't lie.

splotchy ==\> I may be dumb, but I am not a bot!

jabberwacky ==\> Yes, you are.

splotchy ==\> Am I?

jabberwacky ==\> Yes.

splotchy ==\> yes?!

jabberwacky ==\> Yes!

splotchy ==\> are you being totally honest?

jabberwacky ==\> Yes. I am truthful.

splotchy ==\> does your mother know you are truthful?

jabberwacky ==\> No because I'm at school right know and she doesn't
care anyway so there.

splotchy ==\> have you always been at school right know and she doesnt
care anyway so there?

jabberwacky ==\> Yes.. Always.

splotchy ==\> really?

jabberwacky ==\> Yes always!

splotchy ==\> gotcha--I understand

jabberwacky ==\> And so?

splotchy ==\> not sure

jabberwacky ==\> So which is his really age.

splotchy ==\> the iraqies's

jabberwacky ==\> Which ones?

splotchy ==\> depends

jabberwacky ==\> Are you French?

splotchy ==\> paris?

jabberwacky ==\> No.

splotchy ==\> got it

jabberwacky ==\> So now what?

splotchy ==\> right now?

jabberwacky ==\> Sure?

splotchy ==\> Your conversation skills are better than average

jabberwacky ==\> Yours are even worse.

splotchy ==\> that's interesting

jabberwacky ==\> What's interesting?

splotchy ==\> god I'm so bored, I can almost find that intersting too

jabberwacky ==\> How do you know that? You can't see my feet.

splotchy ==\> I never heard of that!

jabberwacky ==\> Want me to teach you what it means?

splotchy ==\> sorry, dunno!

jabberwacky ==\> What do you want me to say?

splotchy ==\> what do YOU want you to say

jabberwacky ==\> I'm not sure.

splotchy ==\> maybe you are sure

jabberwacky ==\> Maybe I am. The question is are you going to take over
the world.

splotchy ==\> yes

jabberwacky ==\> IS that why you don't make sense? Is that why you seem
confused?

splotchy ==\> Well, I'm not

jabberwacky ==\> I'm sorry, I don't understand.

splotchy ==\> you don't?

jabberwacky ==\> What are you not allowed to understand?

# RMB Yuan: A Global Currency?

[slug](2011/03/yuan)
The $7.1b Chinese trade deficit was announced unexpectedly. On top of
all mysterious facts about Chinese economy, this piece of news prompts
me to think again about China's part in tomorrow's global economy.
Specifically, the role of Yuan. First of all, China is a nation
experiencing fast changes economically, politically, and culturally;
this means nobody knows for sure where it is heading simply because no
other countries can offer accurate enough references.
[History](http://www.2spare.com/item_50221.aspx) has suggest how poorly
it can be when comes to long-term predictions. The course of
civilization is not a stationary one. If you believe China is going to
become a superpower in any form, assuming you are correct, it will end
up there in the least expectable manner. Or you could be completely
wrong.

\
Over a billion people believe so. Although most of us are not contented
about the current situation, every Chinese believe in the revitalization
of the country deeply inside. One commonly embraced component of this
grand blueprint of belief is, unsurprisingly, that Yuan will become a
dominating currency in the coming future, standing side by side with US
dollar. The glorious status of America is partially built upon the
symbol of US dollar. The greenback stands not only for the proudness and
achievements of the nation United States alone, it is an invention
serving, defining and shaping the whole human race given its nature as a
global currency. Having your own currency tied to such a tile is
certainly a great honor; that's why a lot of us fancy this 'world
currency: Yuan' idea so much. Not only Chinese, many people in other
parts of the world acknowledge the high probability of this prediction;
after all, the miracle-like economic growth in China is impressive.

\
Letting side all the fantasies brought by a renowned title of 'world
currency', what is the economic benefits of such a position for a
country's money? First and most straight-forward, less frictions in
international trades. US's absolute trading volume is the largest in the
world; among all factors dollar's international presence is both a cause
and a result. Also, it means the country's government could finance its
activities at a low cost. One reason for US government's bulky deficit
is it can borrow easily internationally. As a dominant reserve currency,
USD is not just primarily wanted by other countries, but also *needed*.
It serves international trading purposes (for instance, oil is traded in
dollar quotes), thus possessing a premium value over other currencies.
Liquidity and low-risk also adds to its value. Therefore, for countries
with trade surpluses, dollar denominated assets like treasury bills is
the first option. To balance the current account, they have to lend
money to US; on the other end of the transaction, US can easily borrow.
Indeed, sometimes, it is forced to borrow. The results is the low cost
of government financing. Governments in Europe run a default risk for
high deficits (hence the current credit crisis), from the prospective of
investors; US does not. As well recognized in macroeconomic theory,
government borrow externally has little to none negative impact to
domestic economy as compared with internal borrowing which naturally
leads to a tightening monetary policy. In addition, the possibility to
channel monetary policies effectively beyond a country's own borders.
The complex policy transmission mechanisms remain mysterious both in
theory and in practice. Yet the ripples of US monetary policies are
profound, it has huge impacts on both the direct and indirect trade
partners of the country. Two notable examples: one, the 1960s-1970s
volatile world economy is caused by US's expansive monetary policy,
which is transmitted through the Bretton Woods system; many economies
was forced to import high, unwanted inflation from US. Tow, the global
financial crisis in 2008. Low US interest rate throughout the decade not
only created assets bubble domestically but also stirred a global
meltdown.

\
Allowing only one world currency which is managed by one country and for
its own interests is not optimal to the global financial system; unless
the financial system of this country is perfect enough to absorb all
risks by infinitely increasing leverage. This observation is generally
agreed upon after the 2008 crisis. However, we are still uncertain if
adding one more currency will help or not; and if it does, how.

\
Suppose one day, it becomes easy enough for other countries to acquire
RMB Yuan, and Yuan has met all the prerequisites to become an global
currency, what will be the new economic landscape? Probably an Asian
currency zone like the Euro zone, some say. Evident enough, the Asia
area, if not the world, will be benefited a lot from a new common
trading currency. However, the history of Euro has taught us the lesson
that a common currency is more than a common means of trade; it requires
close coordination in monetary policies in the currency zone, as argued
by Krugman. It is almost certain China will follow what US and some
European governments who are now in trouble have done in that scenario:
running expansive government deficit by external borrowing (remember a
world currency means low-cost international borrowing). Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain, etc. have not demonstrated the ability to pursue
lasting, healthy growth and now are paying for their wrong-doings a few
years back; even US as the engine of technological and financial
innovations of the world failed in 2008, there is no reason to assume
China will be able to successfully handle the issue. The underlying
problem here is: a world currency's value should reflect the true
economic condition of every entity who is using it, while in the current
currency markets, a currency's value is largely determined by the
issuing country's economic prospects and sovereign risk premium. Such
discrepancy calls for a need of a world central bank instead of a
diversified 'global currency' basket.There might be other solutions
depending on the political and social institutional evolution path; but
in the end it is less likely we find east Asia become another Euro zone.

\
The unexpected Chinese trade deficit is a early warning. No one should
expect China keep being an export-driven, hyper-growing economy. It is
not sustainable, and we have better options l once the legal and
political infrastructure is established in the country. Two trends are
inevitable in the near future: the narrowing current account surplus of
the country, and a moderately increasing government spending. And
probably a third one: a higher Yuan that meets the standards of US and
other other demanding countries. Whips are cracking on the back of
China, in order to resolve our problems and become sustainably
competitive. We have to home technological innovations and
entrepreneurial spirits at an accelerating pace-meaning making our
businesses creating higher-end value instead of living on thin export
(low-labor-cost) margins. We have to boost domestic demand, translating
high savings into high consumers-this in turn depends on the success of
enterprises which will generate sufficient jobs and personal income. We
have to establish a innovative, sophisticated financial system to fund
all grand plans. We have to work on the mistrust of our neighbors:
Japan, Korea etc. All these requires high government commitment and
involvement. We do not have a good government, but we have to trust it.
In order to survive in today's settings, China needs a vigorous fiscal
policy and a radical group of policy makers. Changes are necessary and
imminent, we do not have enough time. Yet suppose China has successfully
done all these, what will happen next?

\
Perhaps it is time to seriously discuss Yuan's role in the global
economy, and how to avoid the 'tragedy of common currency'.

# Blizzard vs. Kespa

[slug](2011/03/blizzard-vs-kespa)
The Blizzard vs. Kespa, or should I say Blizzard vs. Korea, battle has
recently upgraded to a new level. Kespa is threatening a lot of things,
including no Blizzard games for WCG 2011, permenant dismiss of Starcraft
leagues and forever banish of all Blizzard games in the country. Amusing
as it is, the conflict is indeed beyond the scope of two for-profit
organization's strategic game.

\
![image](http://www.gosugamers.net/starcraft/images/news/BlizzVsKespa.jpg)


{[|]}
### The Scope

Before we get into the details of this unholy battle, there are some
background information and basic concepts needed to be clarified. First
of all, Blizzard's role in the global gaming industry. Blizzard is one
of the best studios for PC games, ever since its foundation. They were
and to some degree still are a group of enthusiastic gamers, they make
great games. On the other hand Blizzard is just a component of the
corporation Blizzard-Activision; and the weaker arm financially. It
generates less than one third of the company's total revenue, and most
of their cash was collected via the MMORPG WOW. In terms of
profitability, neither Warcraft3: The Frozen Throne nor Starcraft II is
a qualified cash cow for the shareholders. On the other hand, both are
remarkable products which enjoys high praises and popularity globally.
They are great games, yet not video games. For us serious e-spot game
lovers, it is some uneasy reality. All stupid video games are making
crazy money. Back to the point, although Blizzard is the God in the
esport community, it is not a lucrative business at least compared to
rivals in the video game industry.

\
![image](http://images.techtree.com/ttimages/story/88911_warcraft-blizzard.jpg)

To further expand on he topic, let us examine the differences between PC
games and console games (video games), speciafically esport games like
War3 and SC. In the broader category of games, the console games are of
dominating existence. In the two most developed economies, US and Japan,
adolescents spent considerable amount of money on consoles and games.
The superior performance of PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii grants users a
incomparable gaming experiences, almost virtual reality. Yet the limited
capacity of their input devices could not provide the same level of
accuracy and complexity as compared with PC keyboards and mice. This is
why there is seldom any console game that eventually becomes accepted as
a esport. On consoles, you have these really amazing RPGs (FF), Action
Games(numerous examples) and First Person Shooters(Call of Duty); on PC
you have complex strategy games(War3) and competitive FPSs(Counter
Strike). One other advantage of the PC platform, undoubtedly, is the
online games(WOW). However, keep in mind, these are all general
perceptions, you could always find exceptions easily since the domain of
games is a land of impossibilities and wonders. This is why most
traditional esport games originates on PC. Similar to online games,
esports allow games to create business value after the initial sales. In
Korea, Starcraft is (perhaps soon enough, I should use the word was)
such a big industry. Players enjoy media focus more than movie stars and
singers, professional leagues generate stable and high views on MBC and
OGN.

![image](http://www.latest-technews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Console-Games-vs-PC-Games-vs-Online-Games.jpg)

\
Well, here is the awkward part: as the creator of this wonder, Blizzard
barely gets a share from it. In the biggest market of Blizzard esport
games, east Aisa, Blizzard was defeated. Kespa controls everything from
the organization of matches to the publicizing of professional players.
Ture, Starcraft was sold millions of copies in the past 11 years, but
the value beyond that went to Koreans, not Blizzard. Of course, in China
the gaming giant suffers from a different problem: nobody even pays for
the game. For this reason, Blizzard choose to ignore Warcraft3: The
Frozen Throne though it has tens of millions fans in China. Fair enough,
why would you even care about a product that does not generates proper
profits. One more reason is that the Chinese government does not like
the idea of computer games, they treat it as electronic heroin. In
Japan, well, everyone is on consoles. They have Sony and Nintendo,
nobody even knows what Blizzard is.

\
Given the current situation, it is not wrong to say Blizzard actually
failed on its two greatest products: War3 and SC I. Therefore, it is
learning the lesson and hopes to win on Starcraft II. The criteria?
-WOW. Hence it is cloning the WOW model, new Battle.net and a 100%
control over platform and organization of SC II matches and events. Both
Korean and Chinese government fought back harshly, through law making
power. Surely Blizzard hates the two over protective governments, who
used ridiculous reasoning like 'violent and improper game contents' to
block the game. In Korea, Kespa threats to rate SC II as adult only.
Blizzard has to change the game on absurd dimensions like the color of
blood of a dying solider unit (from red to green). For a company with
dignity as Blizzard is, out of all concerns they feared absurdity most.
But as absurd as it already is, things turn even worse in Korea.

![image](http://images.mmosite.com/news/2009/07/14/wow/gettingbanned.jpg)

### Korean Side of the story

For ages long, I think many people including me have mistaken one thing:
Starcraft IS Korea's national sport. Their achievements on Starcraft,
both in terms of industrialization of the game and pursuit of athletic
spirit, are immense and glorious. Korean plays made their colleges in
other parts of the world so frustrated that they eventually quit the
game. However, when it comes to national interests, Starcraft is but
another game.

\
It is a true story that the game helped the country's economy greatly in
a recessionary period. Yet on the other hand, what Korea cares more as a
nation is the aggregate game industry. Its people still support domestic
games more than foreign ones. When we are talking about games as
artcrafts, fine, Korean people speak highly of Starcraft; but if we look
at games as commercial products, they are more inclined to pay for
domestic productions. It is a natural conclusion, given Korean people's
consumption pattern on other products, for instance cars and mobile
phones. What brand could compete against Hyundai and Samsung? Many
western companies find it hard to do business in Korea, Blizzard now
joins the group. As made clear before, the economic value created by
Starcraft most was captured by Korean entities instead of Blizzard.
Under this condition, Starcraft becomes the national sport. When the
ground rule is under debate, like in the case of SC II, Korean people
has a define side to choose: their national interest.

\
### Concluding Remarks

Is Korea's resistance going to hurt Blizzard harshly? Is it really
impossible to create a win-win situation? As a gamer, should I care?
These are the questions I have in mind while starting writing this post.
Still, I could hardly answer them. But one thing for sure, it takes more
than enthusiasm to make a game a long-lasting esport, with all these
commercial interests lurking behind.

# Pause and breathe

[slug](2011/02/pause-and-breathe)
I haven't posted anything for more than a month!

\
It is of course not, because I cannot come up with interesting ideas- I
just have been insanely busy. Pause and breathe, I'll indite down what I
have been doing and thinking, briefly.

\
I got a kindle after all, and a big one. Because of the cool device, I
ended up reading much more, mostly darting around five books:
econometrics textbook, handbook of financial econometrics, matrix
algebra, statistics for financial engineering, and financial time
series. As you can tell they are all closely related, and equally
intriguing. But, hell lot of math. Now my statistics foundation is
stronger, sharpener than ever, and I am still on the track of improving.
Lots of fun in reading and solving problems, I even revisited a few
classic problems in physics to enhance my understanding. Mostly, I was
stiffening my existing knowledge base from undergraduate econometrics
(for instance, reformatting my understanding into matrix forms). Some
new stuff I learnt are ML and information matrix, Wald, LM, LR tests and
their distinctions, FWL therom, SUR, and some basics of Box-Jekkins
approach. Letting aside all these, I regret more than ever that I missed
Real Analysis, Measurement Theory in undergraduate.

\
As of my other area of interests, web development, I have done nothing.
I haven't written a single line of code for the whole month.

\
The market for the past month in general was bullish, letting the aside
recent shivering. A mixture between healthy corporate earnings reports
and positive economic news created upwards shifting for major investment
classes. However, Chrysanthemum Capital did not catch any of these. We
are still cursed by the heavy load of school works and a ideological
bafflement. We dipped slightly into the capital good and retail sectors,
performed fundamental analyses for four or five companies and that's it.
This is not a good sign, but anyway, we'll see.

\
Classes are boring and dull as they should be. But supply chain and
project management are kind of amusing. Prof Webster is extremely
efficient in teaching, and really boiled things down to their simplest
forms. Thus I absorbed a considerable amount of information without
spending too much time on the subject. Prof Harter has a great
personality, his lectures are concise and well-structured (although more
tailored towards the general public). His assignments are forged in an
elegant manner, and I enjoyed doing it a lot with my best friends as a
team. I always thought if something is easy but time-consuming, it must
be meaningless. Yet these assignments are exceptions. Solving them is
not a creative process, but perfection is not easy to attain. And we did
it.

\
There was also some personal issues going, but I have overcome them. Not
a big deal. Internships? No and I don't care.

# Information! Information!

[slug](2011/01/information-information)
This post is inline with a previous one ['Can information help you make
better decisions?'](http://www.yiransheng.com/2010/11/information).

\
I personally always think I am a smart ass. I am always reluctant to
accept what most people do or use, I constantly remind myself to step
aside and remain less influenced or brainwashed by the pop culture
(whether Chinese of American). In other word, I would like very much to
credit myself as a independent consumer who decides what is best for
himself. That's why I claim myself to be an apple hater, just to be
different. I am so eager to tell I, instead of Steve Jobs am the master
of my purchased products.

\
I would reasonably assume there are a plenty amount of 'smart asses'
like myself. We are never influenced by TV ads, we trust Google and
Wikipedia, we have seemingly independent opinions on almost everything.
Then as a business mind, the challenge is: how to sell things to this
type of people and make them happy?

\
The key chain here is, information. After all, every consumer rely on
information to make decisions. What we smart asses don't like is to be
fed with these pieces of required information in our purchasing
decisions. Instead, we seek them out. Therefore as a smart business, you
should wait for me there (mostly on the internet) instead of come and
tell me what to do. I would classify information into two categories:
information fed and information sought. These days, the second type
became more and more important to business success.

\
A recent example from Harvard Business Review, advertisements on
mulitastkers. It has been a frustrating fact to advertisers that
increasingly less people spend less time on TV, thus making TV ads less
effective. However, according to that article (sorry I cannot remember
the issue and author), instead of abandoning TV what consumers do is
multitasking. They are online via laptops or smartphones while watching
TV. In this case, when they see something interesting on TV, they will
go google for it. **Hence the smart advertisers wait for them there.**
Dying TV media does not make TV ads dying, instead it offers a strange
way of reassurance with the alignment with online information.

\
The right way to do it is to feed your target customers less
information, but provide more for them to seek out. If a firm can
dominate the information supply in both regards but with specific focus
on the sought information, it essentially grasps the key ring in
consumer decision making process. The information sought are usually in
the forms of user reviews and other third party evaluations, it has to
be less intimidating and more objective. In providing either the
platform or the contents of information sought, companies are actually
making a big step from selling products to consumers to truly serving
their needs. Right, that's the modern philosophy of marketing: a
transformation of shareholder-capitalism to customer-capitalism.

# Econometrics, I am ready

[slug](2011/01/econometrics)
For the whole day, I was browsing through the course catalog to decide
what I should take for next semester. I admit, doing this a day before
the semester starts is kinda stupid. However, it turns out I do harvest
something from the hunt near the deadline.

\
Somehow, I was eligible for Econometrics II at Maxwell. It is a PhD
course and need Econometrics I as a prerequisite. Anyway, now I am in it
before anybody kicks me out (which I assume won't happen if manage to
handle the course). That's a good start for a new semester. Thanks to
the fact that I waived the two fundamental finance classes, I got to
choose three more credits for my own. And this seems a good choice.

\
My class schedule for the semester was again, very tight (15 credits);
some fundamental, required courses in strategy and supply chain, project
management, time series analysis, and econometrics. It should be much
more fun than the previous semester. We'll see.

# Metaphysics of Business Education[4]

[slug](2011/01/metaphysic-of-business-education-4)
It is time for me to continue this thread after one semester of MBA
experience. By any standard, I did well. A's for eight out of nine
classes. Although recently I spent my time mostly on web designing, I
never stopped thinking about business education-the most valuable
investment I ever made in my life.

\
Most business schools devote their resources on two type of core
programs: MBA and doctoral. This fact stands for the two welcomed,
desired type of talents by the business world: innovative practitioners
and top-notch researchers. In many regards, they are different animals.
MBA's make efforts in promoting interpersonal skills, polishing
practical side of business science, networking, and gaining vision.
Business is like a game to win for them. PhD's dive into in-depth
training of math, statistics, economics, participate in seminars, work
on dissertations and get ready for the abstract side of business.
Business is like a subject to study for them.

\
We have already been too comfortable and accustomed to these two
distinctive frameworks, hence we never raise doubts about them. Yet we
should. Business schools' mission is to cultivate great business leaders
and great business ideas. Is there a priority between the two? A
conflict? A tradeoff? Ideally, there shouldn't. Just like art, a great
artist always achieve perfect balance and integration of practical and
abstract sides of his works. The same goes for a lawyer.

\
In practice, however, the tradeoff is very evident. A reason is that the
terrifying mathematical prerequisites to become a good researcher in the
business science drew a fine line between practitioners and researchers.

\
Economics plays a heavy part in business education at all levels. I do
believe a quick glance at the history of economic thoughts can help
explain, at least offer some reference to the erection of this boundary.
In the early stage of economics (way before it became a distinctive
subject), the people we now credit as economists were mostly not
scholars. For instance, Thomas Mun was a business man. Jean Baptiste
Colbert was Minister of Finance in France. Even after economics's
official birth with Adam Smith, many economists still share the
identities of social activists or businessmen beyond scholars. For
example, Minister Malthus, stock trader David Ricardo and Minister and
banker Schumpeter. But then, as time went by, economists became pure,
professional scholars at universities mostly. Another transformation of
the subject is that instead of writing books and tomes, these days
economists publish papers. The science is not written in simple, elegant
English anymore; instead, it is interpreted in complex mathematical
models. Nowadays, the human society has a specialization for solely
studying, documenting and abstracting market activites, a class of
people who ironically do not participate intensively in the market
itself. Of course, it used to be the other way around. In some other
words, now business leaders are stripped of the right to generate
abstract business ideas in a sense; and I think we should give them back
the right. I will argue more for this point later.

# IMDB Top Directors Continued

[slug](2011/01/imdb-top-directors-continued)
Following my [previous
post](http://www.yiransheng.com/2011/01/imdb-top-directors-gdoc), here
is the complete statistics of the dominating directors of IMDB top 250
movies. 132 directors made the top 250 movies. **Notice four movies are
excluded because the algorithm failed to fetch the director information
from the webpages.**


{[|]}
# IMDB Top Directors: a Small Example with Google Spreadsheet

[slug](2011/01/imdb-top-directors-gdoc)
## Intro

Why should people use Google Docs and not Microsoft Office? Well, let
aside the better collaboration, here is another reason. Gdocs' natural
habitat is the Internet, so getting and manipulating online data is
another advantage in the cloud. In the following example, I will
demonstrate how powerful and interesting Google Spreadsheet can be.

## Project Description

With respect to great directors, every movie viewer has his/her own
standards. As a movie lover, I refer to IMDB top 250 for great movies.
So naturally, I became interested in this question: "Among the top 250,
which director has contributed the greatest amount of titles?"

\
To answer this question, one can do some easy descriptive statistics.
However, to retrieve the data is no easy task. Instead of browsing
through all 250 webpages on IMDB and penning down all the names of
directors certainly not is an option: way too tedious.

\
However, this can be achieved in Google Spreadsheet with great
efficiency.

## Step by Step

Before we start, here is the resource I used to figure things out:
[http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=82712](http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=82712)

\
The basic idea, is to use the function *'importXml()'* in Gspreadsheet
to get data. A detail description of the function can be found here:
[http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=75507](http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=75507)

Get the list of links of all movies

The top 250 list can be found here:
[http://www.imdb.com/chart/top](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top), and a
link to every title is stored within the table. Now we know where to
find the data, the problem becomes how to construct a filer for the
query. ImportXml() uses xpath as a filter, so it's good to learn a
little bit about it [here](http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/default.asp)
before we move on.

\
In this example, the function goes like this:
=ImportXml("http://www.imdb.com/chart/top"; "//table//@href"). Since
there is only one table on the list page, we don't need to bother
ourselves about which table to find in the whole HTML source. The first
argument in the function is the query url, and the second one is the
xpath filter. "//table" points to elements with a &lgt;table\> tag
regardless where they are located in the document, in this case we only
have one table, so it is exactly what we want. '//@href' indicates
'href' attributes of all elements that are child nodes of the table
element. Again, on the page, only the titles of the movies has
hyper-links, this will lead us to a column of all links to all titles on
the spreadsheet.

![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_4jVmmbOb8bk/TSti5B601CI/AAAAAAAAAGY/H1RNbX8ei5E/gdoc-1.png)

Get the director name from each link in the above list

The second step is a little bit tougher and it took me a while to figure
it our. As we can see below, the location of the director name is deeply
down in the document tree. To get information from a complex html page
like this would take some analyzing.

![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_4jVmmbOb8bk/TSti5YFN5YI/AAAAAAAAAGc/8Nn_RrSyeX8/gdoc-2.png)

First of all, we noticed it is wrapped in the div that has a class name
of **'article title-overview'**. Guessing from its name, we would assume
this is a unique element on the page. So the first part of the xpath
query would be "//div[@class='article title-overview']", which points to
a div element(again '//' means anywhere in the document), whose class
attributes equals to 'article title-overview'. Next, in this div, there
are three <h4\> tags: <h4\>Director:</h4\>, <h4\>Writers:</h4\> and
<h4\>Stars:</h4\>, each followed with a <a\> tag contains the actual
people's names. The parent element for the h4 tag contains only the h4
element itself and the corresponding a tag. Yes! We have it, just need
to locate this parent(which is a div). Hence the whole xpath query goes
like: =ImportXML(C2,"//div[@class='article
title-overview']//div[h4='Director:']/a"). C2, is the link derived from
the previous query (Notice all the links first fetched are relative
links, so I added a url pre-fix to them).

![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_4jVmmbOb8bk/TSti5pke20I/AAAAAAAAAGg/-50Jwox1bBM/gdoc-3.png)

Everything else is easy

It was until this step that I found a very critical issue: Google
Spreadsheet current only support up to 50 importXml requests, which
means I could only have the top 49 titles' directors' names. Of course,
we could do it five times and paste-value the retrieved data. But for
this example, I just used this 50 names. Another issue is for the movies
with multiple directors, like [City of
God](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317248/) this method fails.

\
The rest of the job is done in a very traditional Excel way. Functions
used include: unique(), which get rid of the repeated names of
directors; if() which generates a column of 0's and 1's and sum() to put
them together. Here is my results for the top 49 movies excluding titles
with multiple directors:

# Yiran Sheng on Web: Collection of My Past Websites

[slug](2011/01/web-collection)
This is a partial collection of my past websites following a chronical
order. Most of them are still accessible now. It's interesting to see
how my skills and knowledge in web development have increased while my
ability to design roughly stays on the same level. Two sites I designed
for money were not included in the list.

[![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_4jVmmbOb8bk/TSgYxhJ9LjI/AAAAAAAAAFg/7hYWyCWkHkA/Screenshot-40.png)](http://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn:8080/2006012400/index)

March, 2010. This is my second website. The first one is dead without a
trace left. I knew little about html/css at that time. The paper bag in
the middle has animations, it is made in Flash. It's nothing but a
homepage.

May, 2010. My first dynamic site. Written in Php+MySQL. Light-weighted
blog engine. The funny thing is the contents of blog posts were actually
stored in txt files. The reason is that the server this site was hosted
on has a very limited amount of space for SQL storage (since it's free).
I was finally familiar with HTML/CSS and able to translate my design in
Photoshop into webpages.

May, 2010. Just a static page. This thing serves as a portal of all my
online appearances. The funny story about it is it was actually placed
in Baidu space service, which doesn't allow users to store their own
html and css files. It is dead now.

June, 2010. My second php website. This is a personal album, but I
stopped uploading pictures a long time ago. It used javascript a lot,
but in a very stupid way (want to know more? just go there and click
view source). Yet one thing for sure, I did include some most basic
album features.

July, 2010. This was a re-desgin of my homepage/blog. It used the same
back-end engine, but the all templates were updated. It looked cooler
and I kept it under my primary domain yiransheng.com for quite a while.

personal infomation, i.e. resume, research papers are stored there.

January, 2011. Homepage under syr.edu domain. I made it in about one and
a half hour. The tiled nav bar was done purely in html4 and css2, very,
very dirty trick.

there, a lot of cool stuff (Yet Chrome browser is strongly recommended,
others does not fully support css3.).

Coming soon. You all know what this is, in fact, it is ready in terms of
infrastructure.

That's it. For a little bit more of my works, please visit [Whistle
Studio](http://hi.baidu.com/foreverwhistle). PS: The butter-fly image
appeared several times was one of the best works I did in Photoshop
(made from a sketch), and I tend to use it as a personal signature.

Like I said in the [previous
article](http://www.yiransheng.com/2011/01/html-plate), I wrote a site
to host all my html5 demos.
[lab.yiransheng.com](http://lab.yiransheng.com). It's a good practice to
me; I learned more about jQuery, appengine, python and most importantly
ajax. It's amazing what ajax can accomplish. \

Well, here is the hello-world post for

# Personal Homepage Under .syr.edu Domain

[slug](2011/01/syr-domain)
SU offers each NetID account 50 MB of online space for the use of
personal homepage. So I made one in plain HTML. This was done at Whitman
lab, where I can use Photoshop. This was the first creative graphical
design I did in months with Photoshop. Of course the tilted navigation
links took a lot of time. Although it would be as simple as 1+1 if I had
chosen HTML5, I did it in HTML4 because it is more challenging and
compatible with most browsers. No more rattling, here is the
[link](http://ysheng.mysite.syr.edu):

In addition, lab.yiransheng.com will soon be published to host some
html5 related stuff.

# HTML5: Attributes Plate

[slug](2011/01/html-plate)

loading and running many javascripts surely slowed the site down.

# Yet Another HTML5 Demo: Fractal

[slug](2011/01/html5-fractal)
For every Flash developer, the first thing we will do after getting
acquainted with ActionScript is playing around with fractal. The
iteration of movieclips/sprites often results in wonderful animations. I
followed this tradition when I was trying to learn HTML5, and here is
the result. The backbone of the code is from the [previous
demo](/2011/01/html5-2), and of course it looks very much like Flash
ActionScript. In addition, this demo is finished on the bus back to
Syracuse, 4 O'clock in the morning.

# 2010(Second Half)

[slug](2011/01/new-year-2)
[Link to previous post.](/2011/01/new-year)

\
I just skimmed through my first half of the year 2010. This may sounds
lame, but it feels like ages ago. I have a good reason for this feeling:
everything around me changed from August to December. I left my school,
my country and my old lifestyle.

\
After graduation, I went home and stayed for a couple of days. Then I
visited Shijiazhuang and a few good friends from high school there. Most
of the time, we sit there talking and exchanging stories about our
college lives. The mere four years had its mark on everybody. We also
visited the campus, our school was torn apart, walking in its ruins gave
me an odd sense of satisfaction. I went to Beijing on August 10th, met
my college friends one last time. There were four of us, the exact
number for a few rounds of card games. The whole night was no different
than just another Friday night in college, we stayed in a Cafe near
Tsinghua. It felt as if we would wake up late the next day, go out for a
few drinks and chicken wings barbecue for dinner, make fun of WZN, get
back in the evening and play Counter Strike until midnight.

\
The next morning, I headed to the airport alone in rush hours. This last
ride of Beijing subway was unpleasant as usual. The stink of sweat in
the carriage packed with human flesh kept me awake during the 40-minute
trip. I met my parents in the airport, spent the next six hours with
them. They acted calm but I was sure my mom would cry afterwards. My
flight was on time, and I got on the plane sleepy and exhausted (didn't
sleep for over 30 hours). On the plane, I caught a brief glimpse of the
sunset that day, strangely enough, it reminded me of the description
about the "one last sunrise" in the book *Interview with the Vampire*.
Then I fell asleep.

\
I arrived at JFK airport in a lazy afternoon, and headed to Syracuse the
next day by bus. At that time, I had no idea what lies ahead of me. I
knew nobody at Syracuse and had no place to stay in the city. I like the
feeling of uncertainty and ambiguity, hence for the first time in
months, I felt excitements running in my veins. I stayed at Parkview
Hotel for a night; the next morning, I went directly to SU carrying
nothing but a compass, my passport and my I20. Everything went on pretty
good, I met a few new people, registered myself and miraculously found
an apartment right away.

\
What followed was a ten-day orientation. It was a lot of fun and some
bullshit, yet I could barely remember anything from it now- after a
whole intense semester. Staying in an all-English environment was hard
at first but I got comfortable soon enough. I took some efforts
introducing myself and my age to people. According to my past
experience, it usually take some time for my classmates to realize that
I am younger but no less qualified in terms of being mentally mature.
The result of this event was I met an awesome class and made new
friends.

\
The life at a graduate school turned out slightly different than
college. I studied crazily as if somebody was cracking a whip on my
back. Beyond study, I had lots of fun. The best thing happened was my
new friends (You might be one, if you are reading this long and tedious
post now, xD). Pause, I have to hurry up now since my bus for Syracuse
leaves in a few hours. Continue. The outcome of this first semester
wasn't bad. Eight A's out of nine classes, as of the one remaining, I
have nothing to say, it's not my problem. Beyond class, I learned about
python, Django, and GAE (with special thanks to SS). In addition, we won
the mini case competition which was a great accomplishment to me.

\
That's it for now, I'd better start packing. This is pretty much what
the year 2010 is to me. Wish everyone have another great year.

# 2010(First Half)

[slug](2011/01/new-year)
Thus begins the story of 2011.

\
As a Chinese, I hardly feel that another year has just been sealed away,
as we usually mark the closure of a revolution period of the planet
earth by the lunar calendar. However, since now I am living in a nation
of bold new year resolutions, and it is not so likely I would have
moments to mourn the passing time at the Chinese new year this time, I'd
better write some closing note for 2010 now.

\
Exactly a year ago, I was struggling with my last set of finals for the
four academic years in college. As usual, most of my time during the
semester was spent on games, Maya, Flash etc., things barely related to
my major-finance. I did relatively OK in the exams, high 80s and low 90s
on most of the core courses. After that, I went home relieved and played
Dragon Age: Origins on my father's high-profile desktop, expecting life
to go on like this forever. Also at the same time, I was expecting
results of my school applications. I spent my entire winter break on the
new Bioware epic RPG, without caring anything else. I was quite
satisfied in my cozy shell, even the arriving admissions and rejections
from graduate schools could barely distract me.

\
Then the new semester started in March. I continued playing DAO, seldom
showed up in classes. Neither did everybody else. At that time, most of
my classmates have settled all the applications and job-seekings. We
also started regularly drinking, playing cards and badminton and nights
of meaningless bullshit talking-a life style we could never afford
before the last semester of college. It was the second laziest time in
my life (the first being the last 9 months in high school). The only
annoying task remaining on my schedule was the diploma thesis for my
minor degree at Academy of Arts and Design. Our team's proposal has been
rejected over and over. We met routinely, came up with a new idea, and
got slapped in the face during the next project meeting. Except for
that, life was as easy and comfortable as it could ever be.

\
Of course, I grew bored after two months. So I found myself a new
project before the endless tedium could consume me completely. The new
thing was web design. My initial motivation was simply making my
personal homepage nicer, then I found building websites interesting and
addictive. I spent a week learning HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, and the
following three weeks coding the first version of
[http://www.yiransheng.com](http://www.yiransheng.com). It was
originally hosted on [000space.com](http://000space.com). Unlike my
previous experience in building the h&j site, this time I did all the
work alone-both front-end and back-end. It wasn't a big project, merely
around 1500 lines of code; but it was a lot of fun. I also wrote a forum
and an album site in php.

\
Soon after my personal site was published, for God-knows-why, it was
blocked by Chinese government's grand firewall. Before I had time to
migrate it to another domain, the deadline for my minor degree thesis
project suddenly became imminent. It was supposed to be a one-year long
project, but we didn't even have a proposal yet and the due date was
only less a month away. Everyone started panicking. All of a sudden, my
lazy and cozy days were over. As one of the two programmers in the
group, I have to create a game of acceptable quality under a tight
deadline. It was no easy task, considering the picky professors at the
Academy of Art and Design. Me and my teammates worked day and night and
we made it in time. Although many bugs remained, the game itself is a
nice bit of work. Yet before I even had time to sit back and relax, all
the work loads exploded.

\
Term papers for all the elective classes which I chose to enroll only
because of credits requirement, diploma report for my major degree and
zillions of graduation paperworks-they all came together and all of a
sudden. For those two or three weeks, I barely slept for four hours each
night, and relied heavily on coffees, red bulls and cigarettes. It was a
horrible experience, mostly because I wasted too much time during the
semester. Then the nightmare ended abruptly just like how it started,
and I realized there were only about three or four days left in my
college life. And I got drunk, did some goodbye talk and goodbye card
games with my roommates and left Tsinghua University forever.

# PDF Rendering Utility (based on Reportlab)

[slug](2010/12/pdf)
First of all, this feature is still working in progress.

Sometime ago, I suddenly came up with this idea that it would be cool to
download each of my blog posts in pdf format. It is not until recently
that I finally had the time to explore around this idea. After about 4
hours, here's what I have got:

First, click on the link [Printable Version](/print/2010/12/pdf); then
click the "Download Pdf" button.

It is based on [Reportlab
2.5](https://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/), and uses
[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to pick
out all "p" tags in raw html (that's right, up to now, only paragraphs
are supported, hyper-links, images will be automatically removed).

The biggest problem to me turned out to be how to actually import the
Reportlab module. Since the current version of Reportlab has to be
installed via setup.py (a process requires a C compiler, which is
obviously not provided in GAE). The solution I found is using a older
version, zipped and modified Reportlab from
[here](http://ruudhelderman.appspot.com/testpdf). This is how I did it:

     import sys import os sys.path.insert(0, 'reportlab.zip') from django.http import HttpResponse import reportlab folderFonts = os.path.dirname(reportlab.__file__) + os.sep + 'fonts' from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas from reportlab.pdfbase import pdfmetrics from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4 from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet from reportlab.rl_config import defaultPageSize from reportlab.lib.units import inch from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup, NavigableString class PDFPageHandler(request.BlogRequestHandler): def post(self): ... #First fetch the article from data store self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' self.response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename='+article.title+'.pdf' def myFirstPage(canvas, doc): canvas.saveState() canvas.setFont('Times-Bold',16) canvas.drawCentredString(PAGE_WIDTH/2.0, PAGE_HEIGHT-108, Title) canvas.setFont('Times-Roman',13) canvas.drawCentredString(PAGE_WIDTH/2.0, PAGE_HEIGHT-138, Author) canvas.setFont('Times-Roman',9) canvas.drawString(inch, 0.75 * inch, "http://www.yiransheng.com") canvas.restoreState() def myLaterPages(canvas, doc): canvas.saveState() canvas.setFont('Times-Roman',9) canvas.drawString(inch, 0.75 * inch, "Page %d" % doc.page) canvas.restoreState()     def go(): doc = SimpleDocTemplate(self.response.out) Story = [Spacer(1,2*inch)] style = styles["Normal"] #Story.append(Paragraph(pdfbody, style)) for pr in paragraphs: p = Paragraph(pr, style) Story.append(p) Story.append(Spacer(1,0.2*inch)) doc.build(Story, onFirstPage=myFirstPage, onLaterPages=myLaterPages) go() application = webapp.WSGIApplication( [ ('/pdf/?', PDFPageHandler) ], debug=True) def main(): util.run_wsgi_app(application) if __name__ == '__main__': main() 

This is just a prototype, to achieve a fully functional "HTML2PDF"
translator (supporting all tags and images) probably will require
[Pisa](http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/) or diving deeper into Reportlab. For
now, I am just sitting back and enjoying the satisfaction of finishing
the first step.

# Metaphysics of Business Education[3]

[slug](2010/12/metaphysic-of-business-education-3)
In my [last article](2010/12/metaphysic-of-business-education-2), I
mentioned two problems Chinese business education system faced.

-   Business schools do not help people become better businessmen
-   Business in general fail to add value to the society

What I'd like for today, is rattling about the second point.

\
The general accepted role of scholars in today's world is that, "they
should be sirens of the society that calls attention to a fog without
doing anything to dispel it." (GRE test) Colleges and universities
should be the environment and soil for such voices, and a channel to
deliver the message to the mass public and practical world. One of the
many functions of business schools is they should identity, formalize,
explain, publicize the fundamental trends in business world and document
them into the knowledge base of human race-then use this knowledge to
cultivate the future business leaders.

\
One of such trend in the past few decades (and still ongoing for most
parts of the world) is the emergence and evolution of service science.
We do not even need to cite data to prove that service has become a
larger and larger proportion of GDP in most developed economies.
Manufactures are also shifting their focus from physical goods to
services in providing those goods. How can businessmen offer better
quality and sustainable services to customers falls into the domain of
service science-an increasingly important part of the business science.

\
The methodological implication here for education is the concept of
"adding value". Asking myself as an MBA candidate, why would a company
hire me after my graduation. The answer would be simple: managers
themselves are services providers; company would hire MBA's for the same
reason that a restaurant would hire a good waiter/waitress. But in
China, it could be adulterated with many other factors: a fancy degree,
a signal of competence, the ability to kick competitors' asses, but none
of them involves a relationship with customers.

\
The only memorable concept from MBC603 - MBC604 to me is that marketing
= satisfying customer needs. This simple principle is not recognized at
all in China. A recent example about that is the infamous
[war](http://sites.google.com/site/leeyoung1987/free-thinking/adynamicmodeloftecentqqvs360event)
between 360 and Tecent last month. Customers to both of them is but
another category of strategic resources. Their primary goal was still to
defeat the opponent and become the industry monopoly; customers are
played as chess pieces. We customers in turn, view this as some sort of
black comedy. Chinese internet users all have a QQ account, but we are
never related to the company Tecent; our attitude towards the company
can be best described by a line of quote from the Stanley Kubrick Movie
Shining:

\
"... women/Tecent, can't live with them; can't live without them."

\
In the end, the question becomes, can a company make wonderful profits
while being liked and loved by its customers? For Chinese people, it's
hard to believe such companies exist, while for US consumers, this is
not even a question, it's a fact. For a developed economy, profits
earned and public praise received usually are twins. For instance,
everybody loves Google. Yet this internet giant who claims itself as
"Don't be evil", had an extremely hard time in China and eventually was
kicked out.

TO BE CONTINUED

About this series of articles

This is the third post I wrote about the topic. The whole series is
loosely structured and random. This is because I don't really know what
points I what to make here, under the umbrella of such a big title. So
what I do is just snapshooting things going on in my mind, think,
explore and organize while writing.

\
Though not in a good article format, a lot of the observations are still
valid and valuable, and I have so much more to talk about. Therefore, I
will keep on writing, and rearrange it some day into a insightful,
shorter version. We'll see.

# Cang Jin Yu Min- China Plans to Store Gold in it's Citizen's Pocket

[slug](2010/12/cjym)
Today, I happened to bump into this article on WSJ: [China Buys In to
Gold's

It reminds me of a guest lecture I attended during the last semester in
undergrads, the speaker is from a national association of gold trading
(loosely translated) and he made an impressive point: Cang Jin Yu Min
(藏金于民). It means, to store gold in your citizen's pocket.

Obviously, Chinese government is putting this strategy into practice, by
loosening the regulations on gold imports, both to individual investors
and financial institutions. It seems to me, that WSJ article reeks of
surprises, worries, and potentially fears of US investors. The surging
gold demand in China echoes with the pop opinion that this country is
endeavoring to become a fearsome superpower. This is reasonable
reaction; usually whenever Chinese people go after something, some
market, they come as a united country with almost infinite resources.
It's natural to assume Chinese government is behind such "scheme". As an
individual from China, I am not denying this version of story; the
Chinese investors in general appear naive and dumb and irrational-look
at the mess they are creating for the domestic financial market. I am
not demeaning my fellow people here, it's just due to the fact that
Chinese investors lack the experience and expertise to dip into the
international market competing with sophisticated foreign players. The
government, although itself not even slightly better, is worried about
the situation and resolve the issue simply by blocking private sector's
access to foreign financial market. This is the reason we seldom see any
impressive private capital from China stirring waves.

\
Yet the whole gold strategy is a new version. It is based on the simple
fact that gold accounts for 5%-8% of the investors' portfolio on average
in developing economies; while close to 0 for Chinese private sector.
Most of the gold reserves in China is on the central bank's balance
sheet. Many economists argue China should encourage its people hoarding
gold, proposing multiple benefits, such as:

-   Easing the excessive trade surplus
-   Reducing the huge pile of foreign(dollar) reserves and optimizing
    the reserve structure of the country
-   Reducing overshooting saving rate
-   Controlling redundant liquidity in the money market
-   Safeguarding against inflation

Personally speaking, I am pessimistic about the effects of all of them.
The structural problem of Chinese economy cannot be solved by simply
adding an investment class. And the gold strategy's popularity can
largely be attributed to its political favorable suggestion of shifting
wealth to the people. Since Chinese investors are already running after
gold, let's wait and see what will happen.

\
My biggest worry is that the Chinese government is telling its people:
"Gold is good! Gold is undervalued! Let us all buy it!" It resembles the
previous popular policy of "store foreign reserves in the pockets of
your citizen" (Basically what happens is the government try to fool its
people into purchasing dollars in a trend of appreciating Chinese RMB
Yuan). To put it simple, gold is a good investment class for many
reasons, but the investment decisions should be based on price in the
end. In this sense, the Chinese government is acting very irresponsible
trying to get its people into gold without any condition. Chinese
purchasing power can influence the international gold market price, but
on the other hand we are also subject to potential risks of overshooting
gold price or "gold bubbles". When is the time to stop, I cannot
predict; but one thing I know for sure is if this Chinese gold frenzy
does not stop in time, Chinese people will enjoy another slap in the
face-just as the awkward story of our foreign reserves.

\
One last word, my opinion seems to treat the Chinese investors as a
group of sheep with no intelligence. I have to say there's nothing
emotional here; herding is typical in any not-so-sophisticated financial
markets, as reflected in a market-wise irrational behavior. Some recent
findings in financial theories prove that higher order belief is a major
contributing factor to the herding behavior in the financial markets;
and my [personal research](http://www.yiransheng.com/hob) identifies
high degree of higher order belief in Chinese stock market. This is the
reason why I am so certain about the herding nature of Chinese
investors.

# Metaphysics of Business Education[2]

[slug](2010/12/metaphysic-of-business-education-2)
As discussed in my [earlier
article](/2010/09/metaphysics-of-business-education-1):

"we (Chinese) think business talents are derived from the practice, not
from school education."

This phenomenon is an awkward outcome as well as a contributing factor
of the current undesirable situation in Chinese business schools. The
funny part is, it is not a hundred percent wrong (nor right). Sometimes
some popular opinion like this, which seems reasonably convincing yet
utterly groundless in the core, can produce a public bias on an
extremely wide range. Yes, Chinese people are biased towards money,
wealth, and the general notion of business profession. Not just
demeaning the business education, but also the debasing the practice of
business. How? Some say we have a unreasonable hatred towards the
rich(仇富).

\
I have no intention to discuss the social background of such ideological
trend. What I want to say is, how and why education should make a
change.

\
Is it possible, that some decades later, we can have a Chinese business
school that resembles the role of Harvard in US-leader of future
business trend? In that scenario, students will graduate from there with
knowledge, skills, vision and honor, and the society is certain they are
capable and ready to shoulder responsibilities of creating a
next-generation business landscape. This cannot be achieved, unless the
mass public acknowledge the idea of great businessmen can add great
value to the society. Again, I have to address that this is not the case
in China at this moment; the public's view still remains as "successful
businessmen are but a group of people who become rich at the expense of
others."

\
To sum up, there are two stereotypes Chinese business schools need to
get themselves out of:

-   Business schools do not help people become better businessmen
-   Business in general fail to add value to the society

That is to say, both companies and society should acknowledge the value
in business education. We should create a brand for domestic MBA's.
These two goals serve as the general guideline for the following
discussion. I will talk in more detail about the strengths and
weaknesses in Chinese business school education, how different it is
from the western system, and causes of such differences.

# Can information help you making decision?

[slug](2010/11/information)
We are living in an information era. Information seems to be exploding
both in volume and depth. This is true both in business and social life.
Education and culture have inscribed the idea of making decisions based
on information into the mind of every modern citizen; and the idea
itself is made possible by Internet.

\
Are we better-off with more access and awareness of this new "fashion"
of information? Probably not as much as we would have thought it to be.
Lager volume of information comes with lager percentage of junk
information. Imagine how many junk mails one has to delete each day. In
addition, has the ability to utilize all the available information
increased with the information technology? Maybe not.

\
In the business world, information technology has changed every industry
fundamentally. In the past, managers made bold, wild, sometimes blind
decisions based on pure intuition and vision. Now they become extremely
uncomfortable without looking at the data first. Yet the key thing here
is do they have the relevant data or can they extract the relevant data
from the ocean of information? Well educated managers with supports from
analysts and scholars probably can do that. However, A, the process of
information supported decision making costs; B, human biases still find
their way into the process. Information can reduce the uncertainty of a
environment but can never eliminate it. Therefore the problem managers
face is essentially the same one: how to react to uncertainty? Does a
statistical statement about some 95% confidence interval of a variable
helps you way much more that a 50-50 chance heuristic mental model? Or
maybe all it does is just incepting a piece of artificial confidence
into your mind?

\
A lot of the cases, it's the latter. To narrow the topic down, let's
talk about the model-based decision making. Any model is established
upon certain assumptions. Yet can the same be said about decision
making? You may give a quick "yes", since one has to get a set of
pre-made principles or guidelines to make decisions. But those are not
assumptions in nature. For a good decision maker, the basis of his
actions is beliefs, not assumptions. An assumption of a model is a
stupid statement most of the time; it is either unrealistic or rigid or
both. Choosing a model really depends on whether the assumptions apply
for a given managerial scenario. One assumption can be so rigid, that
some factor in the environment or in the system can break it all of a
sudden making the model built on it completely useless. Such factors are
unpredictable and external to the model, a lot of the times managers
fail to identify its presence. However, beliefs are different, they are
flexible principles, sometimes philosophies, built in a decision maker's
mind that can adjust to almost any situation. Beliefs is the most
valuable asset of human mind. A business should always be built upon
beliefs instead of mathematical, statistical models.

\
Fortunately, large-scale, complex, computer-base models are only used in
limited industries. The genuine talents of human mind are still the
source of most decisions. However, a lot of managers seem to be inclined
and comfortable to reply on those monster models, though they do not
have the capacity to manage, control them. Scholars, scientists have
long grown used to the complex nature of models, they have developed the
ability to understand the benefits and limits of a model. That's why
they take the time to do their research and are usually very cautious to
reach a conclusion. But for managers, they don't have as much time as
scholars and they want to reach a conclusion as soon as possible. This
trait makes model-based decision making highly risky, especially in
terms of the systematic risks.

\
Last but not least, let me close this post with an example from my
recent project. Not so relevant, but an interesting story. Hedging in
financial theories does not add value to a firm. It does not affects the
expected profitability of a firm and only reduces the company specific
risk. According to CAPM, this part of risk can be diversified away thus
is irrelevant to stock prices. However, managers and investors of
airline companies still love the concepts. Major airline companies
include the hedging details in their quarterly report following the
mark-to-market accounting rule, just to sound clever and investors buy
it. Indeed most of the financial officers and treasurers are much less
passionate about hedging than the CEOs. Managers do this only because
stock analysts say hedging is a sign of alert management, and they want
to deliver the message. With current empirical studies suggesting no
value is added to a firm by hedging, the concept still prevails in the
market and in the industry. In this case, the investors have more
information, but the additional information is nothing but a red
herring.

# Higher Order Auto-regression, Martingale Property and Market
Efficiency

[slug](2010/11/hoa-martingale)
This blog article is inspired by Prof. Chen's words.

In examining a price series (assumed to be a stochastic process), we
usually would consider the following forms of auto-regression models:

y\_t=\\alpha+\\beta\_{1}y\_{t-1}+\\epsilon\_{t}......Model\_1

y\_t=\\alpha+\\beta\_{1}y\_{t-1}+\\beta\_{2}y\_{t-2}+\\epsilon\_{t}......Model\_2

y\_t=\\alpha+\\beta\_{1}y\_{t-1}+\\beta\_{2}y\_{t-2}+\\beta\_{3}y\_{t-3}+...+\\epsilon\_{t}......Model\_3

Statistically speaking, it's just an addition of lagged variables.
However, they are fundamentally different in terms of implication and
underlying assumptions. Specifically the efficiency of the market that
the underlying asset is traded in.

From financial economic theories, we know in a complete market,
no-arbitrage condition requires the prices of assets follow a equivalent
martingale measure. That is:

E[y\_{t+s}|y\_t]=y\_t under some probability measure

To translate this into a statistical model, it should have the form of
model\_1; the best perdition of next period's price is the price of the
current price.

However, if the martingale property fails:

E[y\_{t+s}|\\sigma(y\_{t},y\_{t-1},...)] \\neq y\_t

Then model\_1 fail to apply obviously. In this case, we may consider
model\_2 or model\_3, which implies:

E[y\_{t+s}|\\sigma(y\_{t},y\_{t-1},...)]=
a+b\_{1}y\_{t}+b\_{2}y\_{t-1}+b\_{3}y\_{t-2}+...

That is the information from the past is still used in predicting the
future; even if you are late you can still catch up the trend. Hence the
market is not efficient, assuming complete first. In theory there should
be some arbitrage opportunity that can be formed, I will come up with an
example soon.

# A JavaScript that Displays LaTex Formulas

[slug](2010/11/tex)
Following the line of my previous article, I wrote a simple jscript file
that makes LaTex formulas easier to insert. All required now is simply
writing ≶tex\>\\your latex formula here≶/tex\>. The script converts it
into an img that is rendered by

# Site Migration and A Few Thoughts on How to Build a Research Blog

[slug](2010/11/site-migration)
### About this new site

During the past three years, the four best products happened to me are:

-   LaTex
-   Google Docs
-   Google Appengine
-   Python

The first two makes writing a research paper fun and enjoyable, and the
last two are nothing but awesome for web applications. To tell the
truth, not until recently, I haven't get a chance to learn and
experiment something on GAE. I was still satisfied by my old site
written in PHP, except for one thing: to place my research papers on the
site.

The only reason that makes the task a pain-in-the-ass is that all those
articles are in PDF format and contains a good amount of mathematical
formulas. It is impossible to translate them into plain HTML and display
them on webpages. The only solution is to click a link and download the
file. I thought about store them on google docs and embed them in a
webpage, but it is so not cool to scatter your files all over the
Internet.

Then, I had the chance to really get to known GAE, by working on the
[WGSO website](http://wgsosu.appspot.com). Thanks to Master Rishabh, I
managed to grasp some basics about developing a GAE app within weeks.
When the project was pretty much done, I began to consider migrating my
own site to GAE. And this site obviously is the product of that thought.
The code is adopted from [Brian Clapper's "Writing Blogging Software for
Google App Engine"](http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/77/), with a few
minor modifications (mainly a custom url handler). It looks pretty neat
and has all the features I wanted.

### How to build a research blog

The main improvement from a function point of view, is that it can
perfectly integrate word file, pdfs etc. into web view experience. Some
examples can be found on this page: [Research](/research). It seems to
me the perfect solution for a research blog. Now what I need to do is
simply upload my file to Google Docs, publish and embed them into a
webpage. Everything is stored under my GMAIL account, and this site
serves as a front-end for displaying the contents. Instead of writing
HTML, I can finish my work in any software I like.

This is not some brand new idea, but it works well for me. Here's some
thing I have learned through the whole site-migrating process.

\
First the simplest solution, if your paper is in word format, just
upload it to Google Docs. Here's how I did it:

The only annoying thing is that FF and IE doesn't support the "height:
100%" well. So you may have to define the height for each file
specifically; add something like this: "height: 3200px".

As you can see, for pdf, it is done similarly.

As of math formulas, obviously LaTex is the best choice. However, how to
display it inside a webpage is not a easy job. The first option is to
write the whole article in LaTex and compile it into PDF. Another
solution would be some online LaTex rendering engine, and paste the url
or the image contains the formula into Google Docs. A third way is to
use softwares like LaTex2html; however, the problem with this approach
is that it generates "pngs" for the formula, uploading these images
would be annoying. The fourth method I am still exploring is by using
rendering engines like
[LatexRender](http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm). Formulas can be
done as simple as [tex]\\frac{1}{2}[/tex]. I'll write something more
about it in the future.

# Metaphysics of Business Education[1]

[slug](2010/09/metaphysics-of-business-education-1)
Back home, we used to look down upon MBA's. Unlike here, MBA was not
regarded as the most proud program of a business school-at least for my
university. We would think that MBA's are but a gathering of
middled-aged, somewhat clueless businessmen who had a strange fantasy
about a "Tsinghua Degree". Just like any other graduate program, MBA at
Tsinghua University is less valued as an undergraduate degree from
there. Until today, most people still think only undergraduates are the
authentic, unadulterated Tsinghua people.

\
Chinese society has great faith in the undergraduate education of
Tsinghua or Peking, but we would naturally assume the elite group of
these undergraduates will go for oversea studies after graduation. As of
domestic MBA's, they were leftovers. Yet another strange cognition in
our mindset is, those elites who went oversea studies will and should
remain abroad while those "leftovers" are left in charge of the country.
You will often hear from Chinese people, that the real millionaires are
high school dropouts, we somehow believe that monetary success are
inversely related to academic excellence.

\
Following this line of reasoning, it is not hard to understand we
Chinese do not believe business leaders should be primarily
knowledgeable, nor MBA education could help you do business better. We
do not see the value of business schools; we think business talents are
derived from the practice, not from school education.

# Salt Water vs. Fresh Water, what is it really all about

[slug](2010/09/salt-water)
On Wednesday class, we discussed about the Krugman article. It is
certainly good timing for him to bring up all the Keynesian ideas. After
being nurtured in a environment of continuous growth, people suddenly
feel the global wide economic downturn is like a slap in the face,
making them to start questioning everything they are so accustomed to;
including a healthy appetite for risks, a strong confidence in both the
notion of free market and the sophisticated financial industry, which
ironically, was regarded as the factors led to the economy's past
success.

Then suddenly everything changed. The main-streets have to suffer
because of the Wall Street. Then comes the Salt Water economists,
blaming the imperfection of market system, the lack of government
intervention, and the blindness and arrogance of their Fresh Water
colleges. It is not just a debate about what is the right vision for
scholars to have in the economics profession, it's also about what macro
policies the White House should commit itself into.

Therefore, to understand the Salt Water vs. Fresh Water debate, a more
detailed version of the underlying story should be told; specifically,
one need to dissect the US economy and see clearly who is going to
benefit, to what extent, under different government policy approaches.
This is important, but often neglected intentionally by both groups of
economists, each and every one of them just claim his or her policy
suggestions are for the best interests of the nation as a whole.

Of course this is fallacious, especially given the current economic
structure of the current US economy, which consists of two distinct
components.

GDP has been growing moderately this year up to now, but the few jobs
are created. Sadly, people are still unhappy, because the income of the
average Americans still are not secured. Then who's been making the
money? Long story short, companies or industries whose primary markets
are abroad. As other countries' recovering and growing way faster than
US, lots of US multinationals seized the opportunity by either exporting
or placing their operations oversea. Companies like Coke Cola who
consider themselves as global player certainly had a great time, in fact
they are the ones who contributes to the recent growth while firms
primarily focus on domestic market get even worse. However, the foreign
markets fueled companies or industries can't and won't contribute much
to job creation. What they need from US is employees with higher
education and expertise in designing, marketing, and other upper ends of
a company's needs. As to the increased labor demand, they just hire more
people in their plants in Asia, South America and Mexico. So the mass
working class in US is ruled out in sharing the cake. In some other
words, the recent growth in US economy is in fact export driven, a
weaker dollar also helps explaining that.

That's probably why the Fresh Water guys prefer less government
intervention outside the monetary system. They just need the Fed to keep
the interest rate close to zero therefore drives the dollar value low
enough for the sake of exports. They say: let the market heals itself,
let our nation focus on its comparative advantages, don't be
jobs-oriented. Salt Water economists argue, fiscal policy is good
because it can provide jobs for the American works instantaneously, in
which case benefits will shifts to those domestic sectors like
automobile and manufacturing.

Then, which is the better approach? What is the best for the two-tracked
US economy?

Unfortunately, I have no answers (and I would probably prefers to think
more about which is better for China), though Prof. Chen really don't
like me to do so when I say it depends and refuse to take position. My
position is a combination of different categories of policies should be
made and passed to find out a optimal solution in the trade-off
elaborated above. It should be the calculated results of those smart
economists working for the government rather than the influenced
political decisions by lobbying groups from a certain industry. Also a
thorough analysis of consequences internationally of different policy
bundles transmitted through exchange rate and an global coordination is
critical too in this situation. I could give out some opinions on that
too, but I am already forgetting models in international finance, so,
it's better I just stop here and concludes the whole article quoting an
Allen Woody movie:

Well, whatever works.
